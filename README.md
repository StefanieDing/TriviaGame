# Trivia Game
Week 5 Assignment: Trivia Game

## A Pixar Trivia

Created during Week 5 of Rutgers Coding Bootcamp. The challenge was to create a timed trivia game. Only 15 seconds were alotted to each question. After all of the questions were finished, the final scoreboard of how well you did would appear.

## Motivation

I wanted to create a Pixar trivia game that was towards the more difficult side and gave animation buffs a challenge. I also created a simpler version for friends and family after the initial app that can be found here: https://pixartriviajr.herokuapp.com/
